# metal_reserved_ip_block

When a user provisions first device in a facility, Equinix Metal API automatically allocates IPv6/56 and private IPv4/25 blocks. The new device then gets IPv6 and private IPv4 addresses from those block. It also gets a public IPv4/31 address. Every new device in the project and facility will automatically get IPv6 and private IPv4 addresses from these pre-allocated blocks. The IPv6 and private IPv4 blocks can't be created, only imported. With this resource, it's possible to create either public IPv4 blocks or global IPv4 blocks.
